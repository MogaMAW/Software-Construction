## The initial Authentication class
 - This class exhibited shortcomings that hindered `readability`, `maintainability`, and `security`. 
<br /><br />
 These included `inconsistent naming conventions`, `sparse comments`, and hardcoded values within methods(`passwords`). 
 <br />

 - We observed that , user passwords were stored directly in the database without hashing, presenting a major security risk.
 
 -  Input validation was lacking,  increasing susceptibility to injection attacks. Additionally, error handling was basic, providing minimal information for debugging.

 with the above shortcomings, we decided to refactor the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and security such that it can be easily understood and maintained by other developers.
