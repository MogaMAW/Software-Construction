# SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTUON 
This repository provides an overview of essential practices and principles in software 
construction, focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and SOLID principles. Software construction is a crucial phase in the SDLC, involving the detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging.
