# SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTUON 
This repository provides an overview of essential practices and principles in software 
construction, focusing on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and SOLID principles. Software construction is a crucial phase in the SDLC, involving the detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing, and debugging.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and is efficient and defect-free. The SDLC involves several distinct stages, including:

Planning: Identifying the scope and defining the project plan.
Analysis and Requirements Gathering: Understanding and documenting what the software must do.
Design: Defining how the software will work and what it will look like.
Implementation (Construction): The actual writing of program code.
Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Updating and fixing software as needed post-deployment.
