# Describing the different phases of theTest-Driven Development

## The Red Phase(calculator_test.py)
#### In this phase, I wrote unit tests for a Calculator class that doesn't exist yet. 
- These tests are covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.

## Green Phase(calculator.py)
#### In this phase, I implemented the Calculator class to satisfy the requirements specified in the unit tests above.

## Refactor Phase(calculator.py)
#### In this phase, I refactored the Calculator class to make it more readable and maintainable.

- This is after I had ensured that all tests pass, I review and optimized the code for readability and efficiency, maintaining passing test cases.
